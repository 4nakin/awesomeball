Awesome Ball is not a game, but a cool little toy to show off what your iPhone can do. 

Shake your iPhone to bounce a ball around with realistic physics and graphics. Double-tap the screen to select a different ball to bounce. Each ball acts differently! 

Customize the ball and the walls with your own images. Take pictures with your iPhone or use photos from your photo library. Whose head will you put on the ball? 

Try these gestures while playing with Awesome Ball: 
- Pinch to zoom in and out 
- Swipe to give the ball a spin 

Wondering what the Easter eggs are? You could try some multi-touch gestures...
