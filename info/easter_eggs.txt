From the main screen:

1 - Slide two fingers all the way down the screen
2 - Slide two fingers all the way across the screen
3 - Rotate two fingers so that they change position
4 - Slide one finger from one corner of the screen to the opposite corner diagonally
5 - Slide three fingers across the screen horizontally

Also, each of these does something different when the device is facing down (towards the floor).
