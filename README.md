Awesome Ball is a 3-D bouncing ball simulator for iOS devices. It uses the Open Dynamic Engine physics engine to model the physical environment and OpenGL to display the graphics. Through the settings screen, the user is able to customize the ball being bounced as well as the box it is bouncing in. Awesome Ball includes several “Easter eggs” (unadvertised features) that can be unlocked with specific multi-touch gestures while bouncing the ball.

In this source code release, you can find the code along with the Xcode project in the "AwesomeBall" subfolder.
The icon and GIMP source file are located in the "icon" subfolder.
The "info" subfolder contains documentation related to the code with high-level summaries of each class used in the program.

We are releasing the code under the BSD license (see LICENSE.txt) in the hopes that it will be useful to some other developers out there. You are free to use the code for personal and commercial purposes, but we ask that you do not simply re-release the Awesome Ball app and sell it as-is. You are on your honor to use only pieces of the code or to make something bigger and better!
